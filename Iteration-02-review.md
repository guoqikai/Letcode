## Decisions that turned out well
- Task assigning 

  We assigned the tasks according to people’s interest and strength, so that everyone was able to contribute efficiently to the project and had their tasks completed. In this way, no one is required to finish a large amount of work they are weak at. However, they are more than welcome to ask questions on parts they feel confused but interested in. 

- Response time

  We decided that the time for each team member to respond to their personal messages is in 24 hours. This makes sure that everyone received an announcement therefore is on the same page. This worked well for us because the fact that each team member works on different features of the project urges us to solve a particular issue immediately. Therefore, we are able to test and write code in an environment where there are no hidden bugs. 

- Zoom screen sharing when coding 
  We sometimes use screen sharing in Zoom to share code and how we wrote it with other people therefore we are able to learn the parts we are not good at. This also minimized the situation where some part of code is unclear to the rest of the group members, and we all agreed that explaining while you coding is a great practise for programmers. 

## Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

- Full autonomy for tasks

  Assumptions were made about what people knew from both a design and technical perspective which did not reflect what they actually know. Assumptions were made that people knew what http error codes and routing were and how they work, but that wasn’t self-evident to those without prior knowledge.

- Setting the deadlines 

  We underestimated the time for integrating our code. Since we are not proficient with our developing tool kits, it took us a lot of time to trace and figure out the bugs during integration.
